Play Crazy 8's against a computer, who may understand the game better than you do!

This game is written in Java, featuring multiple objects, a casino-styled GUI, and an AI opponent.

The game follows the classic rules of Crazy 8's (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights).

The GUI resembles a poker table, featuring a pick up and play pile in the middle, your cards visible at the bottom,
and your opponents cards face down at the top. The computer's cards are hidden, however, you can see how many it has.
